#Description

What I added was the ability to add job grades to the shop, for further customizability. Added in a helicopter shop aswell with the same job grades.

Also removed the RBG for the original config, and removed the impound feature from the buy menu

# Read me
Any car you are adding into the config must also be in your shared vehicle.lua
